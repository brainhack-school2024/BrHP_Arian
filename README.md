   <sub><b>My Avatar</b></sub>
</a>

<p>Hi! I am Arian. I am passionate about the intersection of Neuro and Computer Science.My interests normally revolves around Neuro AI, Neuroimaging. Specifically I want to explore machine/ deep learning algorithms on different type of data like FMRI and EEG. Currently, I am discovering different direction like disease classification, and brain graph structure learning. </p>
 Here is a bit about my background:
<ul>
   <li>
       I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Concordia University, where I have been studying since September 2022.
   </li>
   <li>
       I received my MSc in Computer Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.
   </li>
   <li>
       I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering, specializing in Hardware.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
I would like to express my gratitude for the inspiration and opportunities provided by the incredible organizers of the Brain Hack School.
</p>
